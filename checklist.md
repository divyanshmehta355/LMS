### ‚úÖ **LMS Optimization & Scalability Checklist**

---

#### üß± **1. Project Structure & Code Organization**

* [ ] Refactor into modular apps (`users`, `courses`, `dashboard`, etc.)
* [ ] Use service layer for business logic separation
* [ ] Adopt Class-Based Views (CBVs) where reusable
* [ ] Organize templates and static files per app

---

#### üöÄ **2. Performance Optimization**

* [ ] Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for foreign keys/many-to-many
* [ ] Add pagination to all large listings (courses, lessons, etc.)
* [ ] Implement `{% cache %}` for repeated template blocks
* [ ] Use `only()` or `values()` in queryset optimizations
* [ ] Install and use `django-debug-toolbar` during development

---

#### üõ¢ **3. Database Optimization**

* [ ] Use PostgreSQL indexing on frequent filter/sort fields
* [ ] Consider soft deletes (`is_deleted` flag)
* [ ] Normalize data where needed to avoid redundancy
* [ ] Set up read replicas if scaling reads heavily

---

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è **4. File Uploads & Storage (Appwrite)**

* [x] Upload and store files in Appwrite buckets
* [ ] Generate and store public preview URLs securely
* [ ] Set access control rules for private/public access
* [ ] Use Appwrite CDN links for preview/download
* [ ] Implement size and type validation for uploads

---

#### üîê **5. User Management & Auth**

* [x] Use email for user login (without showing email in form)
* [ ] Add email verification after registration
* [ ] Implement password reset functionality
* [ ] Enable rate limiting (e.g., `django-axes`) to prevent brute force
* [ ] Integrate social auth via `django-allauth`

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **6. Deployment & Infrastructure**

* [ ] Set up Docker/Docker Compose for local & production
* [ ] Use Gunicorn + Nginx or uvicorn for production deployment
* [ ] Enable HTTPS and set `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True`
* [ ] Enable WhiteNoise or use cloud storage for static files
* [ ] Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

---

#### üß† **7. Background Tasks & Asynchronous Jobs**

* [ ] Use Celery with Redis for tasks (emailing, logging, etc.)
* [ ] Offload large file processing (e.g., video transcoding)
* [ ] Queue webhook processing for Appwrite events

---

#### üîí **8. Security Best Practices**

* [ ] Set CSP headers with `django-csp`
* [ ] Use form validation and escape all user inputs
* [ ] Restrict upload file size and types
* [ ] Rotate and manage `.env` secrets securely
* [ ] Enable auto-logout for inactive users

---

#### üìà **9. Monitoring, Logging & Analytics**

* [ ] Integrate Sentry for error monitoring
* [ ] Add logging for enrollment, login, file upload, etc.
* [ ] Monitor uptime & response times (e.g., UptimeRobot)
* [ ] Add Google Analytics or PostHog for usage metrics

---

#### üîß **10. Developer Experience & Testing**

* [ ] Set up unit tests using Pytest
* [ ] Use FactoryBoy for test data creation
* [ ] Add coverage reporting
* [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for linting (Black, isort)
* [ ] Write onboarding guide for contributors
